<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I'm a Crypto Artist and between all the platforms I can use to sell my arts, I wanted it to be Foundation. 
  
Because you have to be either invited or upvote by the community to be an artist on the platform, I decided to create a little game to help succed in this quest. 
  
I made this game thanks to <a href="https://github.com/wayou">@wayou</a> and <a href="https://github.com/vianroyal">@vianroyal</a> and their incredible works which can be found <a href="https://github.com/wayou/t-rex-runner">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/vianroyal/t-rex-runner">there</a>.
  
Enjoy the game and if you want to know more about my art, visit my website : <a href="https://lavoisin.art">lavoisin.art</a> ❤️
