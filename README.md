## About The Game

I'm a Crypto Artist between all the platforms I can use to sell my arts, I want it to be <a href="https://foundation.app">VFoundation App</a>. 
  
Because you have to be either invited or upvote by the community to be artist on the platform, I dicided to create a little game to help to succed in this quest. 
  
This game was made thanks to <a href="https://github.com/wayou">@wayou</a> and <a href="https://github.com/vianroyal">@vianroyal</a> with their incredible works which can be found <a href="https://github.com/wayou/t-rex-runner">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/vianroyal/t-rex-runner">there</a>.
